## üß© Microservices Breakdown

### 1. **Admin Service**
- Register, update, delete, and fetch truck information.
- Stores metadata in MongoDB/SQL.

### 2. **Location Simulator (Producer)**
- Simulates truck movement by sending GPS coordinates every few seconds to Kafka.

### 3. **Location Ingestor Service (Consumer)**
- Consumes messages from Kafka.
- Stores current truck location in Redis (for dashboard).
- Optionally stores historical data in DB.

### 4. **Frontend (Dashboard)**
- Fetches live and historical location data.
- Calls Admin APIs to manage trucks.

## üóÉÔ∏è Data base Management System

‚úÖ SQL for Truck & Driver Metadata
We use a relational database (such as PostgreSQL or MySQL) to store static and structured metadata about trucks and drivers.

üìå Reasons:
Data Integrity: SQL databases enforce strict schema rules, data types, and constraints (e.g., foreign keys), ensuring data consistency across truck and driver records.

ACID Compliance: Guarantees reliable transactions, crucial when updating or deleting critical fleet data.

Complex Queries: Easier to perform joins, filters, and aggregations (e.g., all active trucks assigned to a driver).

Normalized Structure: Tables can be normalized (e.g., separating trucks and drivers), improving maintainability and performance.

Example: A truck‚Äôs model, capacity, registration number, and driver details are relatively static and benefit from strict schema enforcement and relational modeling. Also we can map each truck to it's driver using the foreign and private keys. 

‚úÖ MongoDB for Location History
We use MongoDB, a NoSQL document database, to store the high-frequency GPS trail data generated by trucks.

üìå Reasons:
Flexible Schema: Each truck can have a variable-length array of location data without schema limitations.

GeoSpatial Support: MongoDB natively supports geospatial indexing and queries, like proximity searches and route reconstruction.

Efficient for High Volume Writes: Handles large volumes of location events without needing complex schema migrations.

Document-Oriented Modeling: A single document can represent a truck‚Äôs full movement history, enabling fast read/write access.

Example: Every few seconds, a truck sends its latitude, longitude, and timestamp. These events are stored in MongoDB under that truck‚Äôs document, allowing efficient geospatial queries and visualizations. We might not save the complete duration of the truck but we save the required and most prioritised one's with help of time stamp, latitude and longitudes of the location so for this we might have so much meta data and it may vary according to the vehicle, location and time so NoSQL is preferred.
